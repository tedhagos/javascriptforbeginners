# Overview


# Basic Dev Environment

There are plenty of ways to setup a development environment for learning JS, here are some options;
* Use the VM engine of whatever (modern) browser you have. Chrome, Edge, FireFox and Opera all have modern VM engines that's more than sufficient for your playground
* Use online code-editors/environments like CodePen, JSBin, JSFiddle, Scrimba and many others
* Install a local development stack; a runtime enviroment (Node), a capable editor (Visual Studio Code, or whatever editor you feel comfortable with), a JS linter etc.

For purposes of learning JS basics, an online code-editor/environment will do.

# Typographic convention

When I mark certain parts of the text like this
```
npm init -y
```

That means you need to type it in a command line.

When I'm referring to a piece of code that you need to type in a program files (JS files), I will mark it like this

**Listing. hello.js**

```javascript
console.log("Hello JS")
```

# Hello World 



# Language elements


# Types


# If else


# Switch


# Loops


# Common built-in functions


# Basic DOM management
